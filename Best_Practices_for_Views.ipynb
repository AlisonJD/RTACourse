Views\n","Views are a really powerful tool to analyze large amounts of data really quickly. Normal views do not store any data, they just perform a read from another table on each access. Materialized views store data transformed by the corresponding SELECT query. Live views store the result of the corresponding SELECT query and are updated any time the result of the query changes. \n","\n","We usually talk about materialized and live views. Here we will focus on materialized views here because they really help solving some real-time problems.\n","\n","Materialized views are useful because if you frequently run the same query on a table it makes sense to run the query once, save the result and just fetch that result. They have two downsides:\n"," - They need space.\n"," - They add management work (especially recalculating them when new data comes in). \n"," - They need to be updated and changed if the source schema changes.\n"," - They generally only work for some use cases.\n","\n","\n","Let’s see how to manage these issues and leverage views to get 100-1000x improvements.\n","\n","Views are a way to trade memory and disk to save CPU. That means we will have more things in disk/memory but when we need to use them the CPU will need to fetch less data or do less work than if they didn’t exist.\n","\n","This means spending more money on disk and less money on CPUs.

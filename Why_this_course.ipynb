        "Real-time analytics is now possible. You can analyse large amounts of fresh data with fast queries and be the first to see insights. The real-time component can be ingesting streaming data, fast queries on the data or consuming an API; or any combination of the three. To do real-time analytics well you need to have an understanding of the basics of computer hardware, databases and handling data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today’s platforms are pushing us to develop things ever more quickly, hardware is generally fast enough and developers often don’t need to worry too much about doing things “properly”. That can be fine but there is value in knowing how things actually work.\n",
        "‍\n",
        "Saving a few CPU cycles may not seem like a worthwhile investment but those few cycles multiplied by billions of iterations means less machines to maintain, less money to spend, less complex architectures and, on top of that, the feeling of having almost everything under control.\n",
        "‍\n",
        "Everything sounds really difficult until you understand it, that’s why we created this course. After going through these notebooks you will be able to run real-time analytics on large amounts of data. No matter which platform you use; the principles are the same for all the products and technologies out there.\n",
        "\n",
        "Don’t get us wrong, we obviously don’t know everything, we make mistakes, we just want to explain the principles and the approach that works for us with our clients who are joining the real-time data-driven revolution.\n"

        "Imagine being able to react in real-time to an online marketing campaign, tweaking your actions as you monitor performance, or looking out for attacks on your infrastructure and sending out alerts as soon as a problem appears. The faster you can respond to the insights you are getting from your real-time data the greater the business value.\n",

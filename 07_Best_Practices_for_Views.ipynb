If you always need to do the array join this way to store data then it doesn’t make any sense.\n"," - When you only need the array join for a small % of use cases in which you use the table.

Some databases in this field use Log Structured Merge Trees (LSTM). That means that when you insert data the database writes it to the disk as fast as the hardware allows and then, in the background, merges with other inserts. That improves speed, disk size and so on but has two downsides:\n"," - Between the insert and the compact job the queries will be slower because it has to query more data.\n"," - The background job takes resources and it could affect your query times.\n","\n","During the merge stage some databases allow you to do things.

In other words, it’s a way to save a join.\n","\n","The downside is that databases don’t usually have inverted indices so you might want to generate another column or columns based on array content to be able to index."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iL4egl8qGACl"},"source":["In this example, if we define the table as:\n","```\n","UserId UInt64\n","Timestamp DateTime\n","ClickPoints Array(Int32, Int32)\n","```\n","Then we could do a query to search clicks on a particular zone from people older than 70:\n","```\n","SELECT x, y from ( \n","SELECT * FROM user_events \n","JOIN user_info \n","USING UserId\n","WHERE user_info.age > 70\n",") array join ClickPoints as (x, y)\n","WHERE x between 10 and 100\n","```\n","In this case, if we have, for example, 50 clicks per user as an average, the join will have to do 50x less work. Then the array join generates one entry for each element of the ClickPoints array and we can filter by x, y.\n","\n","Take into account that this is useful in two main situations:\n"," - When it allows you to save joins or other expensive operations. If you always need to do the array join this way to store data then it doesn’t make any sense.\n"," - When you only need the array join for a small % of use cases in which you use the table.
